Vehicle Detection and Tracking Project:

1. ~~Load the data (X_tr, X_val, y_train, y_val)~~  
2. Obtain feature vector  
    2.1 ~~Historgrams for RGB channels~~  
    2.2 ~~Downsampled image (unrolled) or Color info~~  
    2.3 HOG features  
3. Train SVM classifier with feature vectors  
4. Implement Sliding Window method  
5. Implement Heat Map calculation to eliminate false positive detections  
6. Try to use SSD or YOLO (or FCN)
